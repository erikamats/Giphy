# Giphy

With the use of the Giphy API, this dynamic web page populated gifs that help describe me and things I enjoy! It also uses JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate the HTML of the site. 

This webpage also includes a form that takes user input to add additional topic buttons to make functional calls to the API.
