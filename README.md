# Giphy

With the use of the Giphy API, this dynamic web page populated gifs that help describe me and things I enjoy! It also uses JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate the HTML of the site. 

This webpage also includes a form that takes user input to add additional topic buttons to make functional calls to the API.

# How To Use:
1. User can simply click on the button of choice to display gifs.
2. User can add additional gif topics by creating a new button topic which will be added to the already included array.
3. Don't forget to have fun! :)
